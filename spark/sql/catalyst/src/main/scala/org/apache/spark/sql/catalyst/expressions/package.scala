/**
 * A set of classes that can be used to represent trees of relational expressions.  A key goal of
 * the expression library is to hide the details of naming and scoping from developers who want to
 * manipulate trees of relational operators. As such, the library defines a special type of
 * expression, a [[NamedExpression]] in addition to the standard collection of expressions.
 *
 * ==Standard Expressions==
 * A library of standard expressions (e.g., [[Add]], [[EqualTo]]), aggregates (e.g., SUM, COUNT),
 * and other computations (e.g. UDFs). Each expression type is capable of determining its output
 * schema as a function of its children's output schema.
 *
 * ==Named Expressions==
 * Some expression are named and thus can be referenced by later operators in the dataflow graph.
 * The two types of named expressions are [[AttributeReference]]s and [[Alias]]es.
 * [[AttributeReference]]s refer to attributes of the input tuple for a given operator and form
 * the leaves of some expression trees.  Aliases assign a name to intermediate computations.
 * For example, in the SQL statement `SELECT a+b AS c FROM ...`, the expressions `a` and `b` would
 * be represented by `AttributeReferences` and `c` would be represented by an `Alias`.
 *
 * During [[analysis]], all named expressions are assigned a globally unique expression id, which
 * can be used for equality comparisons.  While the original names are kept around for debugging
 * purposes, they should never be used to check if two attributes refer to the same value, as
 * plan transformations can result in the introduction of naming ambiguity. For example, consider
 * a plan that contains subqueries, both of which are reading from the same table.  If an
 * optimization removes the subqueries, scoping information would be destroyed, eliminating the
 * ability to reason about which subquery produced a given attribute.
 *
 * ==Evaluation==
 * The result of expressions can be evaluated using the `Expression.apply(Row)` method.
